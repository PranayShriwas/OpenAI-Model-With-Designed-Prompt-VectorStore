# OpenAI Model with VectorStore Documentation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the Python script that connects to the OpenAI API to generate text based on a prompt, and then stores and retrieves the generated text and its vector embeddings using VectorStore.

## Code Description
The provided Python script utilizes the OpenAI Python library and VectorStore library to perform the following tasks:

1. Set Up OpenAI API
   - Configure the OpenAI API key to authenticate requests to the OpenAI API.

2. Define Prompt
   - Define a prompt string that specifies the task for the OpenAI model to generate text.

3. Connect to OpenAI API and Generate Text
   - Use the OpenAI API to generate text based on the specified prompt.
   - The `openai.Completion.create()` method is used to send the prompt to the API and receive a completion with the generated text.

4. Connect to VectorStore
   - Initialize a connection to VectorStore, a library for managing and querying vector embeddings.

5. Store Generated Text and Embeddings in VectorStore
   - Store the generated text and its vector embeddings in VectorStore using the `vs.set()` method.
   - The embeddings are extracted from the OpenAI API response and passed to the VectorStore.

6. Retrieve Embeddings from VectorStore
   - Retrieve the vector embeddings of the previously stored generated text from VectorStore using the `vs.get()` method.

7. Print Generated Text and Retrieved Embeddings**
   - Print the generated text and the retrieved embeddings to the console.

## Usage
To use the provided script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have installed the required Python libraries:
   - `openai` (for interacting with the OpenAI API)
   - `vectorstore` (for managing and querying vector embeddings)

2. Replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` with your actual OpenAI API key.

3. Define the desired prompt string to specify the task for the OpenAI model.

4. Run the script. Upon execution, it will connect to the OpenAI API, generate text based on the prompt, store the generated text and its embeddings in VectorStore, retrieve the embeddings from VectorStore, and print the generated text along with the retrieved embeddings.

## Dependencies
- `openai` Python library
- `vectorstore` Python library
